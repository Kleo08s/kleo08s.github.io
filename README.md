## How to clone
> [!WARNING]
> There's currently no easy way to customize your site. You'll have to manually edit the text. In the future, you'll be able to change the name and various settings directly from a single file.

Simply create a fork, make your changes (change name, api keys, etc.), and you can publish it with GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages!
